Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy.

明信片总是搅得我假日不得安宁，去年夏天，我去了意大利。

        



I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Everyday I thought about postcards.

我参观了博物馆并且坐在公共花园里。一位友善的服务员教了我几句意大利语，然后他借了我一本书。我读了几行，一个字也看不懂。每天我都想着明信片。 

        



My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!

我的假期很快就过了，但我并没有发明信片给朋友。在意大利的最后一天我做了个重大决定，我早早起来并且买了37张明信片。我待在屋里一整天，但我一张卡片也写不出来！
