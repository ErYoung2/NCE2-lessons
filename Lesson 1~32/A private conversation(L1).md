Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. 

上周我去剧院看剧，我座位很好，戏剧很有趣，但我没办法享受。

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. 

我后面坐了一个年轻男子和一个年轻女子，他们说话很大声。

​	



I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned around. I look at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.

PS: pay attention to, 注意到...

我非常生气。我听不到演员的声音。我扭过头，生气地看着他俩，但他们没注意到我。最后，我受不了了，我再次扭过头，“我啥也听不到啦！”我生气地说。

'It's none of your business,' the young man said angrily. 'This is a private conversation!'

PS: none of your business, 与你无瓜，也可以用nothing to do with you来说

“这与你无瓜”，年轻男子生气地说，“这是私人谈话！”
