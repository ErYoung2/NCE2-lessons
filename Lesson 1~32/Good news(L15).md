The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered.

秘书告诉我，哈姆斯沃斯先生要见我。我进他办公室的时候，非常紧张。我进去的时候，他都没有抬头。

    



After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.

我坐下后，他说生意很差。他告诉我，公司付不起这么庞大的薪水。20个人已经被裁了，我知道轮到我了。

    



‘Mr. Harmsworth, ’I said in a weak voice.

‘哈姆斯沃斯先生’，我有气无力地说。

‘Don't interrupt, ’he said.

‘别打断我’，他说。

Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

然后他笑着告诉我，我年薪找了1000镑。
