I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He has been there for six months. Tim is an engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.

我刚刚收到弟弟蒂姆的来信。他在这边住6个月了。蒂姆是一位工程师。他在一家大公司工作，已经去过了澳大利亚很多不同的地方。

He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice springs, a small town in the centre of Australia.

他刚刚买了一辆澳洲车，现在去了澳大利亚中部的小镇，艾利斯斯普林斯。     



    



He will soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.

他马上将去达尔文。从哪里又要飞去铂斯。我的弟弟还没出过国，所以他觉得这种短途旅程很刺激。

PS: be abroad, 出国
