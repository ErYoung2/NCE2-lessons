If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite.

如果你把车停在错误的地方，一位交警马上就发现了。如果他没给你开罚单，你就走运了。然而，这不会总是发生的。交警有时还很有礼貌。

    



During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car:‘Sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a“No Parking”area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder. ’If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!

一次我在瑞典度假，我发现我的车上有一个条子：先生，我们欢迎您来我们的城市。这里是“禁止停车”区域。如果您注意街边的标语，您会在此过得很开心。这张条子仅仅是一条提醒。‘如果你碰到这种要求，你也很难不遵守吧。
