Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age. At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water.  
实验说明孩子在可以在很小的时候学习游泳。在洛杉矶的一个特殊的游泳池，孩子们成为了水下憋气的专家，甚至在他们学会走路之前。两个月的小孩子似乎并不乐意进到水里去。  

    



It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race. Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water. The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or drag them.  
他们很快就适应了游泳，并能捡起水下的东西。水下三轮车在这些小孩子间非常受欢迎。三轮车并排放在7英尺深的游泳池底上。孩子们彼此竞争到达水池对岸。很多孩子用脚蹬车，但多数孩子更愿意推或是拉着三轮车。  

    



Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for air.  
有些孩子能在全程不出水呼吸哪怕一次。他们是否能成为未来的奥运会冠军，只有时间能说明。与此同时，他们对我们中的那些游不了5码就已喘不过气来的人应该是种鼓舞。
