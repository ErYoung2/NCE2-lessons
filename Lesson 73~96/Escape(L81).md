When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes. Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon changed into the dead man's clothes. Now, dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder, the prisoner marched boldly up and down in front of the camp.  
杀死守卫后，这个战争囚犯快速地钻入了灌木丛。在黑暗中，很快啊，他马上就换上了守卫的衣服。现在，他穿着蓝色的制服，肩扛步枪，在军营前面大胆地来回走着。

    

  

He could hear shouting in the camp itself. Lights were blazing and men were running here and there: they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped. At that moment, a large black car with four officers inside it, stopped at the camp gates. The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed. When they had gone, the driver of the car came towards him.  
他能忍受军营里的大声喊叫。那里灯火通明，大家都跑来跑去。他们已经发现囚犯已经跑了。这时，一辆载着4位军官的大黑车，停在了军营大门前。军官们走出来，囚犯立正站好，并在他们通过时打了军礼。当他们过去之后，司机开着车朝他过来。  

    



The man obviously wanted to talk. He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue eyes. The prisoner felt sorry for him, but there was nothing else he could do. As the man came near, the prisoner knocked him to the ground with a sharp blow. Then, jumping into the car, he drove off as quickly as he could.  
这个司机很明显想聊天。他上了年纪，有着灰色的头发和明亮的蓝眼睛。囚犯很抱歉，但他别无选择。当司机走到他附近时，囚犯一拳把他打到地上，跳上了车，以最快速度开走了。
