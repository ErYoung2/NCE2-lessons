'At the time the murder was committed, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London,' said the man.  
'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.  
'Of course I do,' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer will confirm that I was there on time.'

“凶杀案发生的时候，我正在8点钟去往伦敦的火车上”，男人说。

“你总是赶着么早的火车吗？”探长问。

“当然”，男人回答道。“我必须在十点钟上班。我的老板可以作证我那时在上班。”

    



'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.  
'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'  
'At what time did you arrive at the station?'  
'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'  
'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'  
'Of course not.'  
'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train, but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time. You see, on the morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'

“后一班车也能让你正常上班吗？”探长问。

“我觉得可以，但我从不搭乘后边的车。”

“你什么时间到的车站？”

“7：50，我买了张票并等着上车。”

“你没察觉到哪里不对？”

“没有。”

“我觉得，”探长说，“你在撒谎，我认为你没有赶8点钟的火车，而是8：25火车，它一样可以让你准时上班。你看，早晨的谋杀中，8点的火车根本没运行。它在芬格林车站出了事故，被取消了。”
