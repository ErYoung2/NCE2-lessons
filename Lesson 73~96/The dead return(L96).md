A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them. Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way.

亡灵节在日本每年都举行一次。这个节日是开心的节日，因为在那天，据说死者都会回到他们的家，也会被生者欢迎。因为觉得他们长途旅行都很累，所以都准备了食物。屋外都挂着特制的灯笼，以便帮助死者找到路。

    



All night long, people dance and sing. In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over.

整个长夜，人们唱歌跳舞。第二天早上，为死者准备的食物都被倒去河里，流向海中，因为这些食物如果给生者吃了会不吉利。在靠海的镇子里，头天晚上挂在街上的特制小灯笼在节日结束后也会摆放在水里。

    



Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world. This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.

千千万万的灯笼缓慢地飘向海里，指引着亡灵回到他们的世界的路。当人群站在岸上看着灯笼飘远，直到再也看不到，是一幅令人感动的场面。
