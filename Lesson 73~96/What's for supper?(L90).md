Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain, but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive. So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.

炸鱼薯条是英国最受欢迎的食物，但由于海洋过度捕捞，鱼的价格越来越贵。因此听说北海钻井的潜水员非常害怕大鱼的消息还是令人震惊。钻井平台经常需要修理，潜水员经常需要在水下一百英尺暗无天日的环境中工作，他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的大鱼吓得惊慌失措。

    



Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters. The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length.

现在他们有了特制的笼子，以保护他们避开这些怪物。这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或者杀人的鲸，而是深受人们喜爱的食用鱼品种比如鳕鱼和鳐鱼，但他们非常大，有时长达12英尺。

    



Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who eats who?

这些鱼长这么大有三个原因：海底热的输油管道附近的温暖的海水；钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物；钻井平台附近的渔船数量变少。于是，这些鱼就在这舒服的温暖的水里就吃啊吃，长啊长。到底谁吃谁呢？
