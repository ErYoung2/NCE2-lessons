It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home. I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell, but she was fast asleep, so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window. I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.' I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.

我回到家肯定已经凌晨两点了。我试着按门铃叫醒夫人，但她睡得很熟。于是我从花园的小棚里搬来了一个梯子，拿它抵在墙上，开始爬向卧室的窗户。我几乎就要上去了，这时一个讽刺的声音从下面传来，“我不认为我们需要在晚上清理窗户”。我往下看，看到一位警察，吓得我差点从梯子上掉下来。

    



I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'  
'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'  
'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my key.'  
'Your what?' he called.  
'My key,' I shouted.  
Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me.

我回答了他的话，“我喜欢晚上擦窗户”，但我马上后悔了。

“我也是”，警察用同样的声调回答道。“抱歉打扰您了，我痛恨在一位男士努力工作时打断他。但你介意跟我去趟警察局吗？”

“不，我喜欢呆在这里，”我说，“我没带钥匙。”

“你的什么？”他叫道。

“我的钥匙！”我喊道。

幸运的事，这叫声吵醒了我老婆，在警察向我爬过来的时候她正好打开了窗户。
