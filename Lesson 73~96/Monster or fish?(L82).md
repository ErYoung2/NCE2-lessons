Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea. Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen, it is now known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.

渔夫和航海家有时会声称自己在海上看到了怪物。虽然人们经常笑话这些海员讲的故事，但现在看来，人们看到的许多怪物都是写长相奇怪的鱼。有时，长相奇怪的生物被冲刷到岸上，但他们在海上却几乎不会被捕捉到。然而不久之前，一条长相奇怪的鱼在马达加斯加附近被捕捉到。

    



A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line. Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.

一条小渔船被一条咬住钩的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。渔夫意识到这是条不寻常的鱼，尽量使它不受任何形式的伤害。当这条鱼最终被拖到岸上时，人们才发现他超过了13英尺长。

    



It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail. The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish. Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

它有一个像马的头，大蓝眼睛，亮银色皮肤，鲜红的尾巴。这条鱼那是就被拖进了博物馆，并被一名科学家仔细检查，这条鱼叫浆鱼。这种活着的生物几乎很少被人类发现，因为它们生活在600英尺深的海中。
