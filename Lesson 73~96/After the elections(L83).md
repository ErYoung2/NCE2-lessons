The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the recent elections. He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad. My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane's Radical Progressive Party. After the elections, Patrick went to the former Prime Minister's house.

前首相温特沃兹·莱恩先生在最近的大选中被击败。他现在退出了政界，去了外国。我的朋友帕特里克，一直是莱恩先生的激进党的反对者。大选结束后，帕特里克去了前首相的住处。

    



When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad. On the following day, Patrick went to the house again. The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question. Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.

当他问莱恩先生是否住在这里时，值班的警卫告诉他自从败选后，前首相就出国了。第二天，帕特里克又去了。昨天那位警卫正从门口缓缓走过，当帕特里克问了相同的问题时，虽然这一次很怀疑，但他还是说了同样的答案。

    



The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question. This time, the policeman lost his temper. 'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday,' he shouted, 'Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections. He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!"  
'I know,' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'

第三天，帕特里克又来了，问了警卫同样的问题。这次，警卫蚌埠住了，“我昨天和前天都跟你讲了，”他大喊道，“莱恩先生败选后就退出政界出国了！”

“我知道”，帕特里克答道，“我就喜欢听你说这些！”
