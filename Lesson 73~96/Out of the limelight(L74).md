An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off. Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes, they had taken special precautions so that no one should recognize them. But as they soon discovered, disguises can sometimes be too perfect.  
'This is a wonderful place for a picnic,' said Gloria Gleam.  
'It couldn't be better, Gloria,' Brinksley Meers agreed. 'No newspaper men, no film fans! Why don't we come more often?'

一辆老旧的公交车停在了一条干涸的河床边，车上下来了一群名演员，有男有女。他们穿戴者黑色的眼睛和旧衣服，他们做了提前的防护措施，所以没人认识他们。但当他们马上就发现，化妆的效果有些过分完美了。

“这里很适合野餐呢”，格洛丽亚·格里姆说。

“太适合了，格洛丽亚。”布林克斯利·米尔斯表示同意，“没有小报记者，没有影迷粉丝！我们为啥不多来几次呢？”

    



Meanwhile, two other actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves, had carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some trees. When they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared. He looked very angry. 'Now you get out of here, all of you!' he shouted. 'I'm sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says "No Camping" -- in case you can't read!'  
'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, 'don't be too hard on us. I'm Rockwall Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.'  
'Oh, is it?' said the sheriff with a sneer. 'Well, I'm Brinksley Meers, and my other name is Gloria Gleam. Now you get out of here fast!'

同时另两个演员，罗克沃尔·斯林格和默林·格里夫斯已经拿了两大篮食物到树下的阴凉处。当他们在享受的时候，一个陌生人出现了。他看起来很生气，“现在马上离开这儿，你们所有人！”他大叫着。“我是这里的司法长官，你们没看到提示牌吗？上面写着，不许野餐 -- 除非你们没看！”

“看，司法长官”，罗克沃尔说，“别对我们这么严厉，我是罗克沃尔·斯林格，他是默林·格里夫斯”。

“哦，是吗？”司法长官嘲笑着说。“我是布林克斯利·米尔斯，我另一个名字是格洛丽亚·格里姆。现在你们赶紧走！”
