A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby. He informed the station at once, but no one there was able to explain the mystery. The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news, because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft. He said that someone might be spying on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object.

飞行员注意到一个正飞往附近皇家空军基地的气球。他立马通知了基地，但是在场的人没人能解释这个事儿。控制塔的官员听到这个消息时非常生气，因为气球可能给飞机造成很大的危险。他说可能有人在侦查基地，于是指令飞行员跟踪这个奇怪的目标。

    



The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time. He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars. When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs. Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.

飞行员绕着气球飞了几圈。他发现气球下方的篮子里有3个人，其中一个拿着一支望远镜。当气球飞过基站时，飞行员看到其中一个人开始拍照。马上，气球开始降落，然后它降落在了一个停机坪附近。

    



The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone, for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station! As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!

于是警察来了，但他们没有逮捕任何人，因为篮子里有两位国会议员和基站的司令官！正如司令官之后的解释那样，一半的基地人员不知道另一半人员在干什么！
