I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy. My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays. A flight attendant would take charge of me and I never had an unpleasant experience. I am used to traveling by air and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened.

我小时候曾经坐飞机旅游过很多次。我父母曾住在南美洲，我以前都是飞回欧洲度假的。我总是由一位空乘照顾，我从没有不好的经历。我已经习惯了坐飞机旅游，只有一次把我吓坏了。

    



After taking off, we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport. While we were waiting to land, a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had touched down.

起飞之后，我们低空掠过城市，慢慢地提升高度，然而飞机突然返航并降落回了机场。当我们等待落地时，一名空乘让我们保持冷静并下了飞机。

    



Everybody on board was worried and we were curious to find out what had happened. Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board. The police had been told that a bomb had been planted on the plane. After we had landed, the plane was searched thoroughly. Fortunately, nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again.

飞机上每个人都很紧张，我们都想知道发生了什么。后来我们了解到，飞机上有一个很重要的人。警察被告知飞机上装了一颗炸弹。在我们降落之后，飞机被仔细检查。幸运的是，什么也没找到，5小时之后，我们重新起飞了。
