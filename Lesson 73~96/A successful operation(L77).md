The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an operation. The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate.

死于公元前800年的一位埃及妇女进行了一场手术。这位曾在底比斯神殿里当过歌手的赛潘姆特的木乃伊。由于在给这个木乃伊拍摄的X光片子上有奇怪的斑点。所以，医生们一直试图高清这位妇女是否死于一种奇怪的疾病。唯一鉴别的方法就是做手术。

    



The operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin. The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the god Duamutef.

手术惊醒了超过4小时，由于皮肤上覆盖着一层硬硬的树脂，证实过程非常艰难。医生从木乃伊身上取下一个切片，送去了实验室。他们也发现X光片上没显示的东西：一个蜡制的杜瓦木特夫神小塑像。

    



This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy. The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died. They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open, but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy successfully survived the operation.

这种牛头人身的神像通常被放在木乃伊体内，医生们至今还没搞清楚这位妇女的死因。他们害怕把木乃伊切开后，它会散成碎片，但幸运得很，这种事并没有发生。这句木乃伊成功接受了这次手术。
