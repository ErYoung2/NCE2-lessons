Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteeth century was the Crystal Palace, which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world, for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to see it.

可能19世纪最不寻常的建筑就是水晶宫了，它建于海德公园，为了迎接1851年世博会。水晶宫跟世界上其他所有建筑都不一样，因为它是由铁和玻璃建成的。它是世界上最大的建筑之一，许多国家的许多人都来看它。

    



A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world. There was also a great deal of machinery on display. The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam hammer. Though in those days, traveling was not as easy as it is today, steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe. On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train.

世界各国大量的货物被运送到这里参加世博会。也有大量的机器参展。最奇妙的机器是奈史密斯的蒸汽锤。虽然那时候，旅游并不像现在这么容易，蒸汽船还是载着成千上万的游客从欧洲大陆穿过海峡来来往往。刚到达英格兰，他们就搭乘火车被拉去了水晶宫。

    



There were six million visitors in all, and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges. Later, the Crystal Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.

总共有600万人参观了这里，展会的利润被用于建造博物馆和大学。后来，水晶宫搬去了南伦敦。在1936年失火之前，它一直是世界上最著名的建筑之一。
