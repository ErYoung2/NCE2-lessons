Busmen have decided to go on strike next week. The strike is due to begin on Tuesday. No one knows how long it will last. The busmen have stated that the strike will continue until general agreement is reached about pay and working conditions. Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week. Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides' to people on their way to work.

公交司机打算下周罢工。罢工定于周二开始。没人知道会持续多久。司机们声称此次罢工会持续到关于薪水和工作环境的问题达成全面共识为止。大多数人都觉得罢工至少会持续一周。很多私家车主都决定对上班的人提供“免费乘车”的服务。

    



This will relieve pressure on the trains to some extent. Meanwhile, a number of university students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts. All the students are expert drivers, but before they drive any of the buses, they will have to pass a special test. The students are going to take the test in two days' time.

这在某种程度上会缓解火车的压力。同时，一些大学生自愿在罢工期间驾驶公交车。所有学生都是开车的能手，但是在他们开公交之前，他们需要通过一项特殊的测试。学生们准备在两天后接受测试。

    



Even so, people are going to find it difficult to get to work. But so far, the public has expressed its gratitude to the students in letters to the Press. Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast!

即使这样，人们还是发现去工作还是变难了。不过到现在为止，公众还是像新闻界写信表达他们对学生们的感激之情了。只有一两个人提反对意见，因为学生们开太快了！
