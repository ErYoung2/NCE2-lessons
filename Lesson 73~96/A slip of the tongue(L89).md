People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one. When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all rushed to see it. We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began. Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.

人们总是想尽办法去看一场免费的表演--即使很糟糕。当“皮尤”鸟食公司将在我们当地影院演出喜剧节目的消息传开后。我们都争相去看。我们必须排几个小时的队进场，表演开始前一定已经有了几百人到场了。不幸的是，这场是我看过的最单调的表演之一。

    



Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come. The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme. He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.

那些没能进场看表演的人不必感到失望，因为许多该来的艺术家都没到。我们当晚听到的唯一有趣的东西是节目开始时报幕员的开场白。显然他很紧张，连续几分钟尴尬地站在麦克风前。

    



As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing. We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually said was: 'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!"

当他开口时，每个人都爆发出笑声。我们都知道那人该说什么，但他说的却是：“这是“皮尤”鸟食公司，好女士们，晚上和先生们！”
