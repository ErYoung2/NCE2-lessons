When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago, it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed. The only passengers, a young woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt. It was the middle of winter. Snow lay thick on the ground. The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away.

不久前一架小型飞机偏离了航向，坠毁在了山里，飞行员死了。仅存的乘客有一位怒视和她两个小女儿，没有受伤。这时正是隆冬季节，雪花覆盖了满地。这位女士知道最近的村子在几里之外。

    



When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes she could find. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself, but it was too small.

天气慢慢变黑，她把提箱当做小床，把女儿们放了进去，用所有能找到的衣服盖住她们。夜晚时分，天气特别冷。女子尽可能靠近孩子们，几乎要把她自己也装进箱子，但箱子还是太小了。

    



Early next morning, she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal. Then she had an idea. She stamped out the letters 'SOS' in the snow. Fortunately, a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors of the plane crash.

第二天早晨，她听到飞机飞过头顶，想着自己怎么能发个信号。然后她想到了。她在雪中画了一个"SOS"。幸运的是，飞行员看到了信号，并发了一个无线电广播给最近的阵子。不一会儿一架直升机飞入她们的眼帘，救了这些飞机失事的幸存者。
