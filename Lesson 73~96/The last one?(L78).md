After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette. For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered terribly.

在读了一篇名叫《吸烟与健康》的文章之后，我点了根烟去平复神经。我抽烟很专注愉悦，因为我确信这是我最后一根烟了。整个礼拜我都没再抽过烟，在这段时间，我老婆很受不了。

    



I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a bad temper and an enormous appetite. My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket. After seven days of this I went to a party.

我具备了戒烟者所有的症状：臭脾气和大食量。我的朋友不断像我递烟和雪茄，每当我从口袋里掏出一包糖果时，他们都毫不掩饰地表现出对此非常好笑。就这样7天之后，我去了一次聚会。

    



Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette, it was more than I could bear. I took one guiltily, lit it and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. He himself has done it lots of times!

我身边每个人都抽烟，我觉得很不舒服。当我的好朋友，布莱恩劝我接根烟时，我再也顶不住了。我内疚地接过一支烟，点上并满足地开始抽。一切都恢复正常，我老婆也很开心。不管怎么说，当布莱恩说出来时，戒烟是世界上最简单的事情，他自己都试了好多次了！
