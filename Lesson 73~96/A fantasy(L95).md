When the Ambassador of Escalopia returned home for lunch, his wife got a shock. He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.  
'What has happened?' she asked. 'How did your clothes get into such a mess?'  
'A fire extinguisher, my dear,' answered the Ambassador drily. 'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.'  
'Good heavens!' exclaimed his wife. 'And where were you at the time?'

当艾斯卡罗比亚国的大使回家吃午餐时，他的老婆很震惊。他脸色苍白，衣着呈现吓人的状态。  
“发生了什么？”她问道。“你衣服怎么这么乱？”

“灭火器弄的，亲爱的。”大使冷冷地说。“大学生今早把使馆点了。”

“天啊，”夫人惊讶道。“你那时在那里？”

    



'I was in my office as usual,' answered the Ambassador. 'The fire broke out in the basement. I went down immediately, of course, and that fool, Horst, aimed a fire extinguisher at me. He thought I was on fire. I must definitely get that fellow posted.'  
The Ambassador's wife went on asking questions, when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.  
'And how can you explain that?' she asked.  
'Oh, that,' said the Ambassador. 'Someone fired a shot through my office window. Accurate, don't you think? Fortunately, I wasn't wearing it at the time. If I had been, I would not have been able to get home for lunch.'

“我像往常一样待在办公室”，大使回答道。“火从地下室烧起来，我当然要马上下去了，但那个傻瓜霍斯特把灭火器对准了我。他觉得我烧着了，我一定要把那家伙搞走。”

当大使夫人发现丈夫帽子上的大洞时，她继续问道，“这个怎么说？”

“这个，”大使答道，“有人向我办公室窗户开了一枪，很准不是吗？幸运的是，我那时没戴帽子。如果我戴了，我就不会回来吃午餐了。”
