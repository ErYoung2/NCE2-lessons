Our dog, Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and bark. Every time he wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the gate. As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon became an expert at opening the gate. However, when I was going out shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate.

我们家狗狗，Rex，曾经坐在前门外叫唤。每次他都想进花园时，他就会叫，直到有人开门。由于邻居们都很烦他叫，我老公花了几个礼拜时间训练他用爪子按住门栓，把自己放进来。Rex最后成了一名开门专家。然而，当我们上周正要去购物时，我发现他正呆在花园里靠门的地方。

    



This time he was barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens the gate from the outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my husband removed the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.

这次他又开始叫，所以别人就放他进来了！自那时起，他就有了另一项糟糕的习惯。当他从外边打开门时，他就进到花园来，等着门关上。然后他坐在那里叫唤，直到有人让他粗去。然后他又马上进来，继续叫唤。昨天我老公把门拆了，Rex很生气，我们从那时就再也没见过他！
