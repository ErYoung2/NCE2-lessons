We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all morning. I have been trying to get my new room in order. This has not been easy because I own over a thousand books. To make matters worse, the room is rather small, so I have temporarily put my books on the floor.

我们刚搬家，我整个上午都在忙。我想把我的房间搞整齐一点。这并不容易，因为我有一千多本书。更糟糕的是，房间也小，所以我暂时把书放在了地上。

    



At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room. A short while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the stairs. She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all those books on the floor.

这时，这些书占据了地上空间的每英尺，我必须踩着它们进出屋子。不一会，我妹妹帮我搬一个旧书柜上楼来。她进到我的房间，看到地上全是书，惊呆了。

    



This is the prettiest carpet I have ever seen, she said. She gazed at it for some time then added, You dont need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the carpet!

这时我见过最漂亮的地毯，她说。她看了一会然后说，你根本不需要书架了。你可以在闲暇时坐着阅读你的地毯！
