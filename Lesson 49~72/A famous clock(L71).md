When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben, the famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the B.B.C. If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected. 
当你游览伦敦时，你最先看到的其中一栋建筑一定是大本钟，你可以在全球的BBC当中听到这个著名的钟。如果不是1834年国会大厦失火的话，这栋大钟是不会被建造的。  

    



Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense size, but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich Observatory have the clock checked twice a day.  
大本钟的名字来源于他的设计者本杰明·哈尔，建造国会大厦时负责建造大本钟的人。它不仅大，还极其准时。格林尼治的官员们每天两次校正它的时间。  

    



On the B.B.C. you can hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones are connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once, however, it failed to give the correct time. A painter who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!  
在BBC你能听到钟响，因为钟塔上祖杭了麦克风。大本钟很少走错，然而某一次，它走错了。一个在钟塔上工作的油漆工把油漆桶挂在了某根表针上，导致它走慢了！
