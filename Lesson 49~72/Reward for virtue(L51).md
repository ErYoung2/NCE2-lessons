My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but things got so bad recently that he decided to go on a diet. He began his diet a week ago. First of all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden. The list included most of the things Hugh loves: butter, potatoes, rice, beer, milk, chocolate; and sweets.

我的朋友，休，总是很胖，但最近有个糟糕的事，他决定去控制饮食。他一周前开始控制。一开始，他写了一个单子，列出了所有不能吃的食物。这个单子上包括了大部分休喜欢吃的东西：黄油、土豆、米饭、啤酒、牛奶、巧克力，和糖果。

    



Yesterday I paid him a visit. I rang the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as ever. He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his desk. It was obvious that he was very embarrassed.

昨天我去他那里作客。我按了门铃，并不惊讶于看到休还是那么胖。他让我进屋，并马上把一个大包裹藏在了桌子下边。很显然他非常尴尬。

    



When I asked him what he was doing, he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk. He explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself occasionally. Then he showed me the contents of the parcel. It contained five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!

当我问他，他在做什么时，他愧疚地笑着，然后把包裹放在了桌子上。他解释道，他的节食太严厉了，需要偶尔奖励一下自己。然后他给我看了包裹里的东西，里边有五大块巧克力和三包糖果！
