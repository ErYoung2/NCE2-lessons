Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently.

波兰科学家哈罗恩·塔捷耶夫花了毕生精力研究世界各地的活火山和深洞。在1948年，他去了刚果的基伍湖去观察一个新的火山，后来他给起名叫基图罗。塔捷耶夫可以在火山喷发时，将他的帐篷搭在非常近的地方。

    

Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later.

虽然他努力拍了很多很棒的照片，但他还是不能呆在火山附近太久。他注意到一条岩浆河正朝他流来，眼看就要把他团团围住，但塔捷耶夫还是及时逃出来了。他一直等到岩浆冷却，两天后才又能够回去。

    

This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.

这次，他努力去爬到基图罗的火山口里，在那里能拍照和计算温度。塔捷耶夫经常这么拿命冒险。他总是能告诉我们比其他所有人更多的活火山的信息！
