The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell, was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour. He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird, the car he was driving, had been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2,500-horsepower engine.

伟大的赛车手，马尔科姆·坎贝尔爵士，是第一位开车超过300英里每小时的人。他1935年9月，在犹他州的邦纳维尔盐滩创造了一项新的世界纪录。他开的车，蓝鸟，是他特殊改造的。它长度超过30英尺，和2500马力的引擎。

    



Although Campbell reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour, he had great difficulty in controlling the car because a tyre burst during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell was disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour. However, a few days later, he was told that a mistake had been made.

虽然坎贝尔达到了304英里每小时，但他很难控制车子，因为开始的时候爆了一只轮胎。在他的努力下，他失望地了解到自己只达到了299英里每小时的平均速度。然而，几天后，他得知了一个已经犯下的错误。

    





His average speed had been 301 miles per hour. Since that time, racing drivers have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour. Following in his fathers footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolms son, Donald, also set up a world record. Like his father, he was driving a car called Bluebird.

他的平均速度是301英尺每小时。从那时起，赛车手已经超过了600英里每小时。多年后，他的儿子，小马尔科姆追随者父亲的脚步，也创造了一项世界纪录。跟他父亲一样，他开的车也叫蓝鸟。
