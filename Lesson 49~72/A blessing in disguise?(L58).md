The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a cursed tree. Because the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley has now increased. The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago, but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation.

据说弗林利的一个小村庄有一棵被诅咒的树。由于这棵树已经见报，现在去到弗林利的游客数目就增加了。这棵树在50年前栽种在了教堂附近，但是只有这几年才得到了这个恶评。

    



It is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been asked to have the tree cut down, but so far he has refused.

据说如果某人摸了这棵树，他会得到厄运；如果他捡了一片叶子，他就会死掉。许多村民相信这棵树已经有了很多受害者。人们已经要求牧师把这棵树砍倒，但至今都被拒绝。

    



He has pointed out that the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said, the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden death!

他说这棵树是收入的有效来源，因为全国的游客都络绎不绝地看它。即使有各种说法，游客们仍然络绎不绝地拾取叶子并把他们的名字刻在树干上。至今为止，还没有一个人暴死呢！
