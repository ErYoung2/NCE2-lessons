I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

我穿过街道为了避开碰到他，但他还是看到我并向我跑来。假装没看到他是没用的，所以我向他招手。我从来不喜欢碰到奈杰尔·戴克斯。他总是无所事事，不管你多忙，他总是坚持来见你。我得想办法让他不总跟着我。

       


Hello, Nigel, I said. Fancy meeting you here!  
Hi, Elizabeth, Nigel answered. I was just wondering how to spend the morning -- until I saw you. Youre not busy doing anything, are you?  
No, not at all, I answered. Im going to...  
Would you mind my coming with you? he asked, before I had finished speaking.  
Not at all, I lied, but Im going to the dentist.  
Then I'll come with you, he answered. There‘s always plenty to read in the waiting room!

你好，奈杰尔，我说，见到你真高兴！

你好，伊丽莎白，他回答道。我只是在想怎么度过早上，知道我遇到了你。你今天啥也没忙，对吧？

不不，我说，我要...

你介意我跟你一起去吗？在我说完之前，他问道。

没问题，我撒谎道，但我要去看牙医。

那我跟你去，他回答道。等候室里有很多东西可以阅读。
