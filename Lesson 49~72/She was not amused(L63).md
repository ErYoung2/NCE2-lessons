Jeremy Hampden has a large circle of friends and is very popular at parties. Everybody admires him for his great sense of humour----everybody, that is, except his six－year－old daughter, Jenny. Recently, one of Jeremy's closest friends asked him to make a speech at a wedding reception. This is the sort of thing that Jeremy loves.

杰瑞米·汉普顿朋友圈很大，在宴会上很受欢迎。每个人都喜欢他强大的幽默感，每个人，除了她六岁的女儿，珍妮。最近，杰瑞米的一个老铁要他去婚礼仪式上作演讲。这是杰瑞米很喜欢的事情。

    



He prepared the speech carefully and went to the wedding with Jenny.He had included a large number of funny stories in the speech and, of course, it was a great success As soon as he had finished,Jenny told him she wanted to go home. Jeremy was a little disappointed by this but he did as his daughter asked.

他仔细地准备了演讲，并且和珍妮一起去参加了婚礼。他演讲中包含了一大堆有趣的故事，当然他讲完之后，大受欢迎，珍妮却告诉他，她想回家。杰瑞米有点失望，但他还是带女儿回家了。
    



On the way home, he asked Jenny if she had enjoyed the speech. To his surprise, she said she hadn't. Jeremy asked her why this was so and she told him that she did not like to see so many people laughing at him!

回家的路上，他问珍妮是否喜欢他的演讲。大出所望，她说不喜欢。杰瑞米问她为什么，她告诉他，她不喜欢这么多人笑话爸爸！
