In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel under the English Channel. He said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea level. In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William Low.

1858年，法国工程师埃梅·托梅·德·干蒙，带着修建一条21英里横穿英吉利海峡的计划来到英国。他说在海峡中间建造一个平台是可行的。这个平台可以作为一个端口和火车站使用。如果高高的烟囱伸到海平面上，隧道的通风性会很好。1860年，英国人威廉姆斯·楼提出了一个更好的计划。

    



He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built. This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on March 7,1994, finally connecting Britain to the European continent.

他建议建立一条双火车轨道的隧道。这个会解决通风问题，当火车进到隧道时，会把新鲜空气带进去。24年后一条隧道开始动工。如果此时不是英国怕被侵略的话，它马上就会完工。世界等待这条海底隧道超过100年。最终隧道于1994年3月7日官宣开放，最终连接了英国和欧洲大陆。
