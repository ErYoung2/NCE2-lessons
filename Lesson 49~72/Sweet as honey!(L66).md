In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island, a remote place in the South Pacific, a long way west of Samoa. The plane wasnt too badly damaged, but over the years, the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed.

1963年，一架兰开斯特轰炸机坠毁在了威利斯岛，一个偏远的、在萨摩亚西边很远的一个岛。飞机损坏并不严重，但是多年以后，这次坠毁被遗忘了，飞机残骸也并没有受到破坏。

    



Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island. By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing. The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France. Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored.

1989年，26年后，在一次对岛屿的重新勘查中，飞机被意外地重新发现。到这时，情况良好的兰彻斯特轰炸机还是值得抢救的。法国相关部门把飞机打包并一部分一部分地运回法国。现在一堆热心人都打算去修复这架飞机。

    



It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt. Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition. A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax!

它包含了4个劳斯莱斯引擎，但是这个小组只需要修复3个。想象一下他们的惊讶和高兴，当他们拆开包装后，他们发现第四个引擎跟蜂蜜一样甜，完全是好的！一群蜜蜂把引擎当作了蜂巢，引擎在蜂蜡中被完整保存！
