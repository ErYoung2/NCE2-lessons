A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop. Though she hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed.

一位穿着牛仔裤的女士站在昂贵的商店橱窗前。即使她犹豫了一下，最后还是进去询问了橱窗了那条裙子的价格。接待她的店员并不喜欢她现在的装束。

    



Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other.

蔑视地瞥了她一眼，店员告诉他裙子被卖掉了。这位女士生气地走出了商店，决定在第二天狠狠惩罚这个店员。她第二天早晨又进了店，穿了一件毛外套，左手一个手提包，右手一把长伞。

    



After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.

找到那位无礼的店员后，她要同一条裙子。店员这次不知道她是谁，于是很乐意为她服务。他很艰难地爬上橱窗去拿那件裙子。当她看到裙子后，女人说她不喜欢。她很享受让店员把店里几乎所有东西都拿出来，最后要了第一条。
