Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a childrens hospital. Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied by a guard of honour of six pretty girls, he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo.

去年圣诞节，马戏团团长詹姆斯·盖茨，决定给医院里的小孩子们带点礼物。他穿着圣诞老人的衣服，在由6个漂亮姑娘组成的护卫队的陪伴下，他骑着一头名叫江伯的小象走在城市主干道上。

    



He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing. A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street.

他本应该明白警察不会允许这种行为的却还是这么做了。一名警察靠近吉米，告诉他应该走一条侧路，因为江伯造成了交通拥堵。虽然吉米马上同意了，但江伯却拒绝移动。15个警察不得不非常费力地把它推离了主干道。

    



The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused. Jumbo must weigh a few tons, said a policeman afterwards, so it was fortunate that we didnt have to carry him. Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.

虽然很艰难，但警察们还是很高兴。有个警察后来说，江伯应该有几吨重，所以我们不用背它是很幸运的。当然，我们应该逮捕它，但因为它创了记录，所以我们放过了它。
