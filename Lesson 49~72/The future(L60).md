At a village fair, I decided to visit a fortune-teller called Madam Bellinsky. I went into her tent and she told me to sit down. After I had given her some money, she looked into a crystal ball and said: A relation of yours is coming to see you. She will be arriving this evening and intends to stay for a few days. The moment you leave this tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you know well will rush towards you. She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from this place. That is all.

在一次乡村集会上，我决定去拜访一位叫做别林斯基夫人的算命人。我进到她的帐篷里，她叫我坐下。我给了她一些钱之后，他看了看水晶球，然后说：“您的一位亲人要来看你。她会在今晚到达，打算住上几天。当你离开帐篷的时候，你会有一个大惊喜。一位你熟识的女士会跑向你。她会跟你说一些话，然后带你离开。就这些。”

    



As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my wife hurried towards me. Where have you been hiding? she asked impatiently. Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must be at the station to meet her. We are late already. As she walked away, I followed her out of the fair.

当我出来时，别林斯基夫人说的话我全忘了，因为我老婆跑向我。“你躲哪里去了？”她不耐烦地问。“你妹妹不到一小时后就要来了，我们要去车站接她。我们还没准备好。”当她走开时，我就跟着离开了集会。
