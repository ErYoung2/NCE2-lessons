Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine called The Revealer has been invented and it has been used to detect gold which has been buried in the ground. The machine was used in a cave near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates used to hide gold.

最近，幻想着寻找到失落的宝藏几乎要成真了。一款名叫“探宝器”的机器已经发明出来，并被用于探测被埋在地下的金子。这个机器被用于探测海边一个矿洞 -- 据说 -- 海盗们在此藏了金子。

    



The pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it. Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to find buried treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was gold under the ground.

海盗们经常把金子买在这里，然后就没挖出来。由于有新机器，一个探险组织进了这个洞，想挖出被埋葬的宝藏。组织头头探测时入口附近的土壤时，机器显示地下有金子。

    



Very excited, the party dug a hole two feet deep. They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless. The party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything except an empty tin trunk. In spite of this, many people are confident that The Revealer may reveal something of value fairly soon.

他们非常激动，于是挖了个2英尺的洞。他们最后发现了一枚小金币，毫无软用。他们于是仔细地探索了整个洞窟，但除了一个空铁皮箱外，一无所获。即便如此，许多人仍然确信这个机器会马上发现有价值的东西来。
