Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for years to buy a real bed. For the first time in his life, he became the proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress. Because the weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house.

厌倦了睡地板之后，一个德黑兰的小伙子攒了很多年钱买了一张真正的床。他平生第一次自豪地拥有了既有弹簧又有床垫的床。因为天气太热，他把床搬去了房顶。

    



He slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it crashing into the courtyard below. The young man did not wake up until the bed had struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces, the man was miraculously unhurt.

前两晚上他睡得非常好，但是第三晚上，暴风来了。一股暴风把床从房顶扫下来，然后把它重重地摔在了院子里。在床落地之前，这个年轻人还没醒。虽然这个床摔得粉碎，但是男人居然神奇地没受伤。

    



When he woke up, he was still on the mattress. Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him, the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house. After he had put it on the floor, he promptly went to sleep again.

他醒来时，还在床垫上。他看了看眼前摔碎的床板，伤心地建起了床垫，把它搬进了屋里。将床垫放在地板上之后，他接着又睡着了。
