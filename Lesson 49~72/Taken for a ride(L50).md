I love travelling in the country, but I dont like losing my way.  
I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I expected.  
Im going to Woodford Green, I said to the conductor as I got on the bus, but I dont know where it is.  
Ill tell you where to get off. answered the conductor.

我喜欢在乡下旅游，但我不喜欢迷路。

最近我做了一次短途旅行，但是我花的时间比期望要长。

我上公交时跟售票员说，我要去伍德福德草地，但我不知道在哪。

“我会告诉你在哪里下的”，售票员回答道。

    



I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside. After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock that I was the only passenger left on the bus.  
Youll have to get off here, the conductor said. This is as far as we go.

我坐在公交车的前部，能看到乡下非常好的景观。不一会儿，公交停了。四周一看，我吃惊地发现就剩我一个游客了。

“您该下车了”，售票员说，我们开到头了。

    



Is this Woodford Green? I asked.  
Oh dear, said the conductor suddenly. I forgot to put you off.  
It doesnt matter, I said. Ill get off here.  
Were going back now, said the conductor.  
Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus, I answered.

“这里是伍德福德草地吗？”我问道。

哦我的天，售票员突然说。我忘了让你下车了。

“没事”，我说，“我要下车了”。

“车要回去了，”售票员说。

“喔，这样的话，我还是呆在车上吧”，我回答道。
