The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars. Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble. The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty! NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it.

哈勃望远镜于1990年4月20号由NASA在太空部署，花费了超过十亿美元。但一开始，哈勃望远镜出了些问题。它发过来的图片非常差劲，因为主镜头有问题！NASA计划修正这个望远镜，所以他将送4位宇航员去太空修复它。

    



The shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble. A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs. Of course, the Hubble is above the earth's atmosphere, so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen. The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe. By the time you read this, the Rubble's eagle eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

奋进号航天飞机将他们送到了哈勃望远镜那里。奋进号的一只机械臂会抓住望远镜，并在宇航员修理的时候保持状态。当然，哈勃望远镜在地球大气层之外，所以它会发送最清晰的，我们未曾见过的恒星和遥远宇宙的图片。哈勃望远镜会告诉我们很多关于宇宙年龄和大小的信息。当你读到这里时，哈勃的鹰眼已经发送给我们超级多张优质的图片了。
