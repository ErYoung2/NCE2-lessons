After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the shops. It was still early when I returned home. The children were at school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. So I decided to make some meat pies. In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry.

早饭之后，我送孩子们去学习阿弥，然后我去了商店。我回到家的时候也还早。孩子们在学校，老公在上班，家里很安静。所以我决定做一些肉饼。很快我就把黄油和面粉混合，我的手上沾满了黏稠的混合物。

    



At exactly that moment, the telephone rang. Nothing could have been more annoying. I picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when I recognized the voice of Helen Bates. It took me ten minutes to persuade her to ring back later.

正在这时，电话响了。没有比这个更令人生气的了！我用两只粘稠的手指拿起了话筒，得知是海伦·比茨的声音时我很震惊。我花了十分钟劝说她等一下再打来。

    



At last I hung up the receiver. What a mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on the telephone, and on the doorknobs. I had no sooner got back to the kitchen than the door bell rang loud enough to wake the dead. This time it was the postman and he wanted me to sign for a registered letter!

最后我挂断了电话。真糟糕啊！混合物在我的手指上、电话上、门把手上。我刚回到厨房，电话又响了，声音大得能吵醒死人！这次是邮递员，他要我签收一封挂号信！
