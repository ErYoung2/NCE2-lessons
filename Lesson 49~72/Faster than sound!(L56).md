Once a year, a race is held for old cars. A lot of cars entered for this race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it began. One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels.

旧式汽车的比赛每年一次。在去年，许多车参加了比赛。比赛开始之前，人们异常激动。其中最靓的车之一是劳斯莱斯生产的银鬼汽车。最不寻常的车是一辆三个轮子的奔驰。

    



Built in 1885, it was the oldest car taking part. After a great many loud explosions, the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some drivers spent more time under their cars than in them! A few cars, however, completed the race.

最老的车，生产于1885年。在一阵喧闹的爆炸声之后，比赛开始了。许多车在途中抛了锚，许多司机在底盘下修车的时间比他们在车里的时间还长！然而，还是有许多车完成了比赛。

    



The winning car reached a speed of forty miles an hour -- much faster than any of its rivals. It sped downhill at the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop it. The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure. It was very different from modern car races but no less exciting.

获胜的那辆车，速度达到40英里每小时。大幅领先于它的对手。它在接近终点时，冲下了山坡，司机废了好大劲才停下来。这场比赛让每个人都很开心。它虽然与现代汽车比赛同，但丝毫不逊于它。
