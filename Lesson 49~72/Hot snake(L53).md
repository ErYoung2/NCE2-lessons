At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California. Since then, they have been trying to find out how the fire began. Forest fires are often caused by broken glass or by cigarette ends which people carelessly throw away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass.

最终，消防队员们扑灭了加利福尼亚严重的的山火。这时，他们就想知道火是怎么烧起来的。山火通常因为人们无意中扔掉的破碎的玻璃或者烟头。昨天消防队员们仔细地检查了地面，但他们没有发现任何碎玻璃。

    



They were also quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. This morning, however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a 16,000-volt power line. In this way, he was able to solve the mystery.

他们也十分确信，烟头无法引起火灾。然而，今天早晨，一个消防员偶然发现了原因。他发现在16000伏特电线旁边有一条被烧焦的蛇的尸体。于是，他就解决了这个谜题。

    



The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had snatched up the snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down to the ground and these immediately started a fire.

这个解释很简单，但是很不寻常。一只鸟从地上抓起了这条蛇，把它扔到了电线上。当它这么做的时候，就有火花掉在地上，立刻引起了一场大火！
