My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England. He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner returned than he bought a fine house and went to live there.

我的老朋友，哈里森，住在地中海地区很多后回到了英格兰。他经常幻想着在英格兰退休并计划在乡下安居。他迫不及待地回来，买了一间很好的房子，然后就在那里居住了。

    



Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted as if he had never lived in England before.

没过多久他就开始抱怨起天气来，因为即使是夏天，也会连续下雨，而且特别冷。在温暖的地方住了多年之后，哈里森对此感到惊奇。他表现得就好像没在英格兰住过一样。

    



In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The dream he had had for so many years ended there. Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.

最后，他受不了了。还没等安顿下来他就卖掉了房子，离开了英格兰。他多年的梦想就终结了。哈里森想到了一切，除了天气。
