Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer. My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told me to rest for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton wool. He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection was growing.

牙医们总是在你回答不了问题的时候问问题。我的牙医刚拔了我一颗牙，并让我休息一下。我想说什么，但我嘴里全是棉花。他知道我收集了很多火柴盒，就问我是不是有新藏品。

    



He then asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my new job in London. In answer to these questions I either nodded or made strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt very worried, but could not say anything. When the dentist at last removed the cotton wool from my mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.

然后他问我我兄弟怎么样，我是否喜欢伦敦的新工作。作为这些问题的回答，我不是点头就是发出奇怪的声音。同时，我的舌头拼命地寻找拔牙以后的洞洞。我突然很担心，但是我啥也说不出。当牙医最后拿掉我嘴里的棉花时，我终于能说话了，并告诉他他拔错牙了。
