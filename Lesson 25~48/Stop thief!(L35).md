Roy Trenton used to drive a taxi. A short while ago, however, he became a bus driver and he has not regretted it. He is finding his new work far more exciting. When he was driving along Catford Street recently, he saw two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a waiting car.

罗伊·特雷顿曾是个出租车司机。稍早之前，他成为了一名公交车司机，他并不遗憾。他发现新工作更刺激了。当他最近在凯特福德街上行驶时，他看到两个抢匪冲出一家商店并跑向了一辆停着的车。

    



One of them was carrying a bag full of money. Roy acted quickly and drove the bus straight at the thieves. The one with the money got such a fright that he dropped the bag. As the thieves were trying to get away in their car, Roy drove his bus into the back of it.

其中一个背了一个装满钱的大包。罗伊马上行动起来，他开着公交车径直冲向了抢匪。背着钱的那个抢匪非常恐惧，把包丢了。当这两个抢匪企图逃跑时，罗伊开着公交撞在了那辆车的尾部。

    



While the battered car was moving away, Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police. The thieves' car was badly damaged and easy to recognize. Shortly afterwards, the police stopped the car and both men were arrested.

当这辆被撞坏的车开走后，罗伊停下公交车，然后报了警。这两个抢匪的车损毁严重，很容易辨认。不一会儿，警察逼停了这辆车，并抓住了两个匪徒。
