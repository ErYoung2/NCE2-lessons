A public house which was recently bought by Mr.Ian Thompson is up for sale. Mr.Thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted. He told me that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise coming from the bar.

伊恩·汤普森先生刚买的小酒馆现在又要卖出去。汤普森先生之所以要卖，是因为那里经常闹鬼。他告诉我，他某天晚上睡不着，因为他听到酒吧里传来奇怪的响声。

    



The next morning, he found that the doors had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr.Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning. He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which the ghost must have drunk the night before.

第二天早晨，他发现门被椅子堵住了，家具也移动过。虽然汤普森先生在睡前已经关了灯，但是灯却是开着的。他还说他还发现了5个空的威士忌瓶子，这肯定是鬼昨晚喝的。

    



When I suggested that some villagers must have come in for a free drink, Mr.Thompson shook his head. The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.

当我告诉他肯定是一些村民进来喝了顿免费的酒，汤普森先生摇了摇头。村民们早就告诉他，即使他把小酒馆送人，他们也不要。
