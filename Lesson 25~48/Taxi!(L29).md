Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service. The ‘taxi’ is a small Swiss aeroplane called a ‘Pilatus Porter’. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers. The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: or snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.

本·弗西特机长买了一辆不同寻常的出租车，开始了新的业务。这辆“出租车”是一架小型瑞士飞机，叫“皮勒特斯·波特”号。这架超棒的飞机可以搭载7位乘客。最令人惊异的是，是它能在任何地方降落：雪地、水上、甚至刚耕过的田里。

    



Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places. Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman.

弗西特机长的第一位乘客是一位从伯明翰飞威尔士山区某山卡拉村子的医生。自此以后，弗西特机长就载客人去了很多不寻常的地方。一次他降落在了一栋公寓的房顶上，另一次，他降落在了一个废弃的停车场。弗西特机长刚拒绝了一位商人的奇怪需求。

    



The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous.

他想飞去大西洋上一个孤岛--罗卡尔岛，但是弗西特机长没有载他去，因为这趟旅途太危险了。
