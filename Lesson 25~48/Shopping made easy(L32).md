People are not so honest as they once were. The temptation to steal is greater than ever before----especially in large shops. A detective recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store on Monday mornings.

人们不再像以前那样诚实了。偷窃的诱惑力正在大幅上升--特别是大商场里。最近一个侦探观察到一位衣着光鲜的女子总是周一早晨进到商场里。

    



One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than usual when the woman came in, So it was easier for the detective to watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.

某个周一的早晨，店里的人比平时还少，这女的又来了，因此对于侦探而言，她更好监控。这个女的先是买了几样小商品，不一会儿，她选了店里最贵的裙子之一然后递给店员，店员非常迅速地包起了衣服。

    



Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without paying. When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop assistant was her daughter. The girl ‘gave’ her mother a free dress once a week!

然后这个女的就走了，根本没付钱。原来店员是她女儿，每周一都‘送’她妈妈一件免费的衣服！
