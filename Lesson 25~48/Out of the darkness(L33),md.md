Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain what had happened to her. One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small boat and was caught in a storm. Towards evening, the boat struck a rock and the girl jumped into the sea.

在女孩能够描述发生在她身上事情的一周之前，某个下午她坐着一艘小船从海岸出发，然后被卷入了风暴当中。快晚上的时候，这艘船撞上了岩石，她就跳入了海中。

    



Then she swam to the shore after spending the whole night in the water. During that time she covered a distance of eight miles. Early next morning, she saw a light ahead. She knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs.

然后她在水里泡了整个晚上，最后游向了岸边。那期间她游了8英里的距离。第二天早晨，她看到一束光射过来。她知道她在岸边了，因为这束光是从峭壁上来的。

    



On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the light she had seen. That was all she remembered. When she woke up a day later, she found herself in hospital.

上岸之后，女孩努力爬上了峭壁，朝着看到的光源走去。这就是她所有记得的东西了。当她第二天醒来时，她发现自己已经在医院了。
