当一架从伦敦飞来的飞机到达悉尼机场时，工人们开始搬一堆装着衣服的木箱子上飞机。没人能搞明白为什么一个箱子特别重，当一个工人打开箱子时，所有人都惊呆了。

    

He was astonished at what he found. A man was lying in the box on top of a pile of woolen goods. He was so surprised at being discovered that he did not even try to run away. After he was arrested, the man admitted hiding in the box before the plane left London.

He had had a long and uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the wooden box for over eighteen hours. The man was ordered to pay $3,500 for the cost of the trip. The normal price of a ticket is $2,000!
