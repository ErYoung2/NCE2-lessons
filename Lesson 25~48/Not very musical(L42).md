As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of Old Delhi, we stopped at a square to have a rest. After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look at him. As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets.

在德里的某市场走了很长的路之后，我们停在广场上想休息一下。不一会儿，我们发现广场那边有两个玩蛇的，带着两个大篮子，所以我们就过去看。当他看到我们时，他就拿起了一个长长的上面镶有硬币的管乐器，并掀开了一个筐的盖子。

    



When he began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake. It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe. We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs.

当他开始吹奏时，我们第一次看到了那条蛇。它从篮子里爬出来，开始跟着管乐的节奏扭动。当耍蛇人开始吹奏爵士和现在流行乐时，我们更加惊奇了。

    



The snake, however, continued to ‘dance’slowly. It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!

然而这条蛇还是在慢摇。很明显它还没办法分辨印度音乐和爵士的不同！
