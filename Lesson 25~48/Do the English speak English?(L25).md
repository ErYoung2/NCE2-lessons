I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter. I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well.

我终于到了伦敦。火车站很大，很黑很暗。我不知道去酒店的路，所以我问了一个搬运工。我说英语不仅很仔细，也很清晰。

    

    



The porter, however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me, but he spoke neither slowly nor clearly. ‘I am a foreigner,’ I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that!

但是这个搬运工并不懂我说什么。我重复了好几次我的问题 ，最后他终于懂了。他回答我，但他说话既不仔细也不清晰。‘我是个外国人，’我说。然后他慢慢地说着，但我啥也听不懂。我的老师从来不这么说英语！

    

    



The porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and I understood it. ‘You'll soon learn English!’ he said. I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?

这个搬运工与我四目对视，相视一笑。然后他说了一些话，我终于懂了。‘你马上就会学会英语了！’他说。

我懂了，在英国，每个人都说一种不同的语言，英国人能相互听懂，我就不行！他们说的是英语吗？
