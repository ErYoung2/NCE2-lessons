Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs.Rumbold. Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I tried to make conversation.

上周的晚宴上，女主人要我坐在兰伯尔德夫人的身旁。兰伯尔德夫人是一位身材高大、不苟言笑的女士，穿着紧身黑色裙子。我坐在她旁边时，她甚至没有抬头看我一眼。她的眼睛紧盯着盘子，不一会，就开吃了。我试图跟她聊聊天。

    



‘A new play is coming to“The Globe”soon,’I said. ‘Will you be seeing it?’  
‘No,’she answered.  
‘Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?’I asked.  
‘NO,’she answered.  
‘Will you be staying in England?’I asked.  
“No,’she answered.  
In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.  
‘Young man, ’she answered,‘if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!’

“有一部新剧要在环球剧场上演了”，我说，“您要去看吗？”

“不去”，她回答道。

“您今年出国度假吗？”我问道。

“不去”，她回答道。

“您待在英格兰吗？”我问道。

“不”，她回答道。

我无语了，就问她吃得好不好。

“年轻人”，她答道，“如果你多吃点、少说点，我们都会喜欢这顿饭的！”
