The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home. I like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons. It was warm last Sunday, so I went and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children were playing games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.

威利河是一条横穿了我家公园附近的小河流。我喜欢在天气晴朗的下午在威利河旁坐着。上周日，天气很好，所以我去了河边，跟平常一样坐在河岸边。一些小孩子在岸边玩游戏，河面上有人在划船。

    



Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went towards a passing boat. Some people on the bank called out to the man in the boat, but he did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he nearly fell into the water.

突然，一个小孩非常用力地踢了一个球，把它踢向了一艘路过的船。岸上的一些人对着船里的人喊叫，但是他听不到。这个球狠狠地砸到了他，他几乎掉进水里。

    



I turned to look at the children, but there weren't any in sight: they had all run away! The man laughed when he realized what had happened. He called out to the children and threw the ball back to the bank.

我扭过头，看了看孩子们，但没有看到：他们已经跑了。这个男人意识到发生了什么，笑了。他大声叫着孩子们，把球丢回了岸边。
