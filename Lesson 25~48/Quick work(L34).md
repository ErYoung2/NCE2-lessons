Dan Robinson has been worried all week. Last Tuesday he received a letter from the local police. In the letter he was asked to call at the station. Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to the station yesterday and now he is not worried anymore.

丹·罗宾逊整周都很慌。上周二他收到当地警局的一封信。信中他被要求去警局传讯问话。丹想知道他为什么被警察传讯，但他昨天还是去了警局，现在他就一点不慌了。

    



At the station, he was told by a smiling policeman that his bicycle had been found Five days ago, the policeman told him, the bicycle was picked up in a small village four hundred miles away. It is now being sent to his home by train.

在警局里，一位微笑着的警察告诉他，他丢失的自行车在五年前找到了。这位警察告诉他，这辆自行车是在一个500英里外的小村庄找到的。现在正通过火车送回他家。

    



Dan was most surprised when he heard the news. He was amused too, because he never expected the bicycle to be found, It was stolen twenty years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!

当他听到这个消息时，丹十分惊讶。他也很高兴，因为他从未期望自行车可以找回来，这辆车在20年前就被偷了，那时他还是个15岁的孩子！
