The whole village soon learnt that a large sum of money had been lost. Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his savings to the post office. Sam was sure that the wallet must have been found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him.

整个村庄立刻发现丢了一大笔钱。当地的屠户萨姆·本顿在去邮局的路上丢了钱包。萨姆确认钱包肯定被村里某人捡到，而没还给他。

    



Three months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his wallet outside his front door. It had been wrapped up in newspaper and it contained half the money he had lost, together with a note which said: A thief, yes, but only 50 per cent a thief! Two months later, some more money was sent to Sam with another note: Only 25 per cent a thief now! In time, all Sams money was paid back in this way. The last note said: I am 100 percent honest now!

三个月过去了，一个早晨，萨姆发现钱包在他前门口。钱包被报纸包着，里边有他丢钱的一半，还有一张便条，上面写着：贼，是的，但只拿一半的钱。又两个月之后，更多的钱送过来，有另一张条子：现在是25%的贼。这次，所有钱都回来了，最后一张条写着：现在百分百诚实了！
