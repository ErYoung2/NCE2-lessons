I am an art student and I paint a lot of pictures. Many people pretend that they understand modern art. They always tell you what a picture is ‘about’. Of course, many pictures are not ‘about’ anything.

我是一名艺术生，画了很多幅画。许多人假装他们很懂现代美术的样子。他们总是跟你说，一幅画是什么“意思”。当然，很多画根本没“意思”。

    



They are just pretty patterns. We like them in the same way that we like pretty curtain material. I think that young children often appreciate modern pictures better than anyone else. They notice more. My sister is only seven, but she always tells me whether my pictures are good or not. She came into my room yesterday.

它们只是漂亮的图案。我们喜欢它们就像喜欢好看的窗帘材料一样。我觉得小孩子比其他人更喜欢现代图画。他们更关注于此。我妹妹只有7岁，但是她总是跟我说，我的画到底好不好。她昨天进了我的房间。

    



‘What are you doing?’ she asked.  
‘I'm hanging this picture on the wall, ’ I answered. ‘It's a new one. Do you like it?  
’She looked at it critically for a moment. ‘It's all right, ’ she said, ‘but isn't it upside down?’  
I looked at it again. She was right! It was!

“你在做什么？”她问道。

“我在把这幅画挂到墙上，”我答到。“这是幅新画，你喜欢吗？”

他批判地看了看，“还好，”她说，“不过，是不是挂倒了？”

我又看了一下，她是对的！
