Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences as a young man. Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop.

昨天下午弗兰克·霍金斯向我讲述了他年轻时的经历。在他退休前，弗兰克是一家非常大的商业公司的经理，但当他还小时，他在小铺里做工。

    



It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day. He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own. In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes. At that time he had two helpers.

他的工作是修自行车，那时他一天工作14个小时。他存了很多年钱，在1958年，他买了一间自己的小铺。弗兰克20多岁时，生产飞机零部件。那时他有两个助手。

    



In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people. Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success. He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair their grandson's bicycle!

多年以后，这间小铺子已经成长为了一间拥有728雇员的大厂。弗兰克想到他早年的艰难岁月和通往成功的道路时笑了。他夫人走进来的时候他还在笑。她夫人要他去修孙子的自行车！
