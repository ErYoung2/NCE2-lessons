Late in the afternoon, the boys put up their tent in the middle of a field. As soon as this was done, they cooked a meal over an open fire. They were all hungry and the food smelled good. After a wonderful meal, they told stories and sang songs by the campfire.

傍晚时候，孩子们在田野中间搭起了帐篷。当帐篷搭起来的时候，他们就生火烤肉了。他们都很饿，东西闻起来也很香。美餐一顿之后，他们在萤火旁讲故事、唱歌。

PS: put up, 搭起来；as soon as，当...

        



But some time later it began to rain. The boys felt tired so they put out the fire and crept into their tent. Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable, so they all slept soundly. In the middle of the night, two boys woke up and began shouting.

但不久之后，就开始下雨了。孩子们累了，所以他们扑灭了火，钻进了帐篷。他们的睡袋都很暖和舒适，所以他们睡得很香。夜中，两个孩子起来了，并且开始喊叫。

PS: put out, 扑灭

    

    



The tent was full of water! They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and hurried outside. It was raining heavily and they found that a stream had formed in the field. The stream wound its way across the field and then flowed right under their tent!

帐篷里全是水！他们全部出了睡袋跑了出来。雨下得很大，他们发现这块地里出现了小溪。这条小溪弯弯曲曲穿过原野，正好从他们帐篷下面钻过去！
