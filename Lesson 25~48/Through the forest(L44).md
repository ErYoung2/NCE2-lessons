Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran through a forest after two men. They had rushed up to her while she was having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to steal her handbag.

安·斯特林夫人在穿过森林追赶两个男人时，她并没有考虑到所冒的风险。这两个男人在她和孩子们在森林边缘野炊时冲向她，并试图偷取她的手包。

    

In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in their possession, both men started running through the trees. Mrs. Sterling got so angry that she ran after them. She was soon out of breath, but she continued to run.

在争抢中，手提包的带断了，包落入这两个人手里，他们拔腿跑进了树林。斯特林夫人非常生气，就开始追。她马上就喘不上气了，但它继续跑着。

    

When she caught up with them, she saw that they had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag, so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright that they dropped the bag and ran away. ‘The strap needs mending,’ said Mrs. Sterling later, ‘but they did not steal anything.’

当她追上他们时，她看到他们已经坐下来翻看包里的东西，所以她径直走向他们。这两个男人十分害怕，他们扔下包就跑了。“包带要弄一下”，斯特林夫人说，“他们什么也没偷走”。
