‘Do you call that a hat?’I said to my wife.  
‘You needn't be so rude about it,’my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror.  
I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror.

“你管这叫帽子？”我问老婆。

“你不用这么粗鲁辣，”老婆边照镜子边回答我。

我坐在一个新式的满是网眼儿的椅子上，等待着。我们在这家帽子店带了半个小时，我老婆还在镜子前。

    



‘We mustn't buy things we don't need,’I remarked suddenly. I regretted saying it almost at once.  
‘You needn't have said that,’my wife answered. ‘I needn't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday.’  
‘I find it beautiful, ’I said. ‘A man can never have too many ties.’  
‘And a woman can't have too many hats，’she answered.  
Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!

“我们不要买不需要的东西辣”，我突然提醒她。然后我立马就后悔了。

“你不该这么说，”老婆回答道。“我不用再提醒，你10天前买的那条辣鸡领带了吧。”

“我觉得很好啊”，我熟，“男人有多少领带也不嫌多。”

“女人有多少帽子也不嫌多，”老婆答道。

十分钟之后我们一起出了店，我老婆戴了一顶好像灯塔一样
