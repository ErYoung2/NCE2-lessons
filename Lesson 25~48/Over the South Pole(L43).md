In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American explorer, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first time. Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay below, they soon ran into serious trouble.

1929年，在他飞过北极点的3年之后，美国探险家，R·E·伯德首次成功地飞越了南极点。虽然，一开始，伯德和他的团队能够从上空拍摄很多山的照片，但很快他们就遇到了麻烦。

    

At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash. It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet. Byrd at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet.

在某个地方，他们的飞机似乎要坠毁了。只有飞过10000英尺的告诉才能飞过高山。伯德马上要他的团队扔掉两个沉重的食物袋。这飞机才能升高，超过山峰400英尺飞过去了。

    

Byrd now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away, for there were no more mountains in sight. The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.

伯德现在知道他能飞到距离南极点300英里的地方了，因为视线里已经没有其他山了。飞机可以毫无困难地飞越这篇无尽的白色原野。
