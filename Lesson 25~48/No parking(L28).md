Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths. He has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in, he has had trouble with cars and their owners. When he returns home at night, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate.

贾斯珀·怀特是少数几个相信古代秘密的人之一。他在城市里买了一套新房子，但自从搬进去后，就开始与汽车与其车主有了摩擦。当他晚上回到家时，他总是发现有人在他门口停车。

    

    



Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once. Jasper has put up ‘No Parking’signs outside his gate, but these have not had any effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen.

于是，他便无法将自己的车开进车库，哪怕只有一次。贾斯珀于是在门口竖起了“禁止停车”的标语，但是并没有什么用。现在他搬了一块极丑的石头头像放在了门口。这是我见过最丑的石像。

    

    



I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. Jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has been turned to stone yet!

我问他这是什么，他说这是“蛇发女巫玛杜莎”。贾斯珀希望把停在他家门口的车和车主都变成石头。但是到现在为止还没有谁真正变成石头呢！
