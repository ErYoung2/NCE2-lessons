Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky.

钓鱼是我最喜欢的运动。我经常钓几个小时的鱼，但什么也钓不上来。但我对此并不担心。总有那么几个倒霉的渔夫，他们钓不上来鱼，总是钓上来靴子和垃圾。我就更不走运了。

    

    



I never catch anything ---- not even old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. ‘You must give up fishing!’ my friends say. ‘It's a waste of time. ’

我啥都钓不上来--包括旧靴子。我总是在河上呆了整个早晨之后，一无所获回到家。“你还是放弃钓鱼吧，”朋友跟我说。“这是浪费时间”。

    

    



But they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all!

但是他们都没意识到一件重要的事情。我并不是醉心于钓鱼，我只是喜欢坐在船上，什么都不做！
