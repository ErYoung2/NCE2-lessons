Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Jow wins every time.

乔·桑德斯有我们这个小镇上最美丽的花园。每一年，小镇上几乎每个人都会参加‘最美花园评选’，但每次都是乔获胜。     

    



Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool.

比尔比乔更努力，他在自己的花园里种了更多的花朵和蔬菜，但是乔的花园更有趣。他把小径弄得很干净，并且在池塘上建了一座木桥。

PS: over, 在...之上         





I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!

我也喜欢花园，但我不喜欢收拾。每年我也参加花园竞选活动，但我总是喜提"最差花园"的微不足道的奖励!
