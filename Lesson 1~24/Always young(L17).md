My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be at least thirty-five years old. In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl. Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will be a girl of seventeen.

我姑姑詹妮弗是一位女演员。她肯定至少已经35岁了。尽管如此，她总是看起来都像一个少女的状态。詹妮弗马上要参演一部新剧了。这次，她要演一个17岁的小姑娘。    

    

    

In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, ‘Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!’

剧中，她必须穿一条亮红色的裙子和黑色的高筒袜。去年的另一部剧中，她被迫穿短袜和亮橘色的裙子。如果有人问她多大年纪，她一定会说，‘亲爱的，长大真是太糟糕啦’！

must: 主动的选择，必须

have to: 被动的选择，不得不
