I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the south of France, I drove on to the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift.

我去年有一次很神奇的经历。在我离开法国南部的一个小村庄后，我驾车开往下一个小镇。在路上，一位男士向我招手。我停下来，他要我载他一程。

    



As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey.

他上我车以后，我用法语对他说“你好”然后他也用法语回复我。可是我并不懂太多法语，除了常用的几句。我们一路上就没再说几句话了。

    



I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, ‘Do you speak English?’As I soon learnt, he was English himself!

快到的时候，这位男士立刻慢慢地说，“你讲英语吗？” 这时我立马意识到，他原来是个英国人！
