I had a letter from my sister yesterday. She lives in Nigeria. In her letter, she said that she would come to England next year. If she comes, she will get a surprise.

我昨天收到一封姐姐的信。她住在尼日利亚。信里她说，她明年会搬来英格兰了。如果她来了，她会收到一份惊喜。

    

We are now living in a beautiful new house in the country. Work on it had begun before my sister left. The house was completed five months ago. In my letter, I told her that she could stay with us.

我们现在住在乡下漂亮的新房子里，这栋房子在我姐姐离开之前就动工了，它在五个月前竣工。在我信里，我说她可以跟我们住在一起。

    

The house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden. It is a very modern house, so it looks strange to some people. It must be the only modern house in the district.

这间房有很多大房间，还有一个讨人喜欢的花园。这是非常现代的房子，所以它对于某些人挺奇怪的。但它一定是这个地方唯一的现代化住宅。
