I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs.

我刚刚搬去大桥街。昨天一个乞丐敲了我的门。他问我要一顿饭和一杯啤酒。作为回报，这个乞丐倒立起来，然后唱歌。

PS: ask for, 要求

PS++: in return for, 作为回报

PS++++: stand on one's head, 倒立 

    



I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.

我给了他一顿饭。他把食物吃完，然后喝酒。然后他把一块奶酪揣进口袋就走了。 

    



Later a neighbour told me about him. Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons.

后来一个邻居跟我讲了他的事情。每个人都直到他，他的名字是珀西·巴顿斯。 



    



He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

他一个月内会敲开街上的每一间房子各一次，然后总是要一顿饭和一杯啤酒!
