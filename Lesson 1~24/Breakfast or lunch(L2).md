It was sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. 

那是个星期天。我星期天从不早起。在周末，我有时会睡到午饭时间。上周末我起得很晚。我看了看窗外，非常黑。

"What a day!" I thought. "It is raining again." Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train.' she said, 'I am coming to see you.'

“玛德什么鬼天气！”我想，“又下雨了。”这时，电话响了。是我的姑妈露西。“我刚刚坐火车过来”，她说，“我要过来看你。”

'But I am still having breakfast,' I said.

“但我还在吃早餐，”我说。

'What are you doing?' She asked.

“你说你在干啥？”她问道。

'I am having breakfast,' I repeated.

“我在吃早餐，”我回复道。

'Dear me,' she said, 'do you always get up so late? It's one'o clock!'

“卧槽”，她说，“你总是起这么晚吗，现在都下午1点了！”
