My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle.

我的女儿，简，从没想过能收到来自荷兰跟她一样岁数的女孩的来信。去年，我们去了海峡对岸旅游，简把一张写有她名字和地址的纸片放入了一个玻璃瓶里。

    

    



She threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.

她把这个瓶子扔到了海里。自此之后，她就没再想过这事了。但是十个月后，她收到了一封来自荷兰女孩子的信。两个女孩现在经常写信。然而，他们决定通过邮局来通信。这样会花多一些钱，但是会快很多。
