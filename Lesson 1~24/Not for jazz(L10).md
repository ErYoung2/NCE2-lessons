We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord is kept in the living room.

It has belonged to our family for a long time . The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago . Recently it was damaged by a visitor . She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard and two of the strings were broken.

它属于我们家族已经很久了。这台设备是我祖父很多年买的。但它却被一个来访者弄坏了、她居然试着去演奏爵士乐！她敲击琴键太狠，导致两条琴弦断了！

PS: strick, 敲击；string，悬挂线、琴弦

    



My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to touch it . It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.

我父亲很震惊。现在我们都不能碰它了。现在它在我父亲朋友那里修缮。
