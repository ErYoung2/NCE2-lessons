I entered the hotel manager's office and sat down. I had just lost ￡50 and I felt very upset. ‘I left the money in my room, ’I said, ‘and it's not there now. ’

我走进酒店经理的房间，坐了下来。我丢了50镑，我非常生气。‘我在酒店房间放钱了’，我说，‘现在没了’。

    

The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing. ‘Everyone's losing money these days,’ he said. He started to complain about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock at the door. A girl came in and put an envelope on his desk. It contained ￡50.

经理深表同情，但也无能为力。‘这些天每个人都在丢钱’，他说。他开始抱怨这个邪恶的世界，结果被一阵敲门声打断。一个女孩走进来，把一个信封放在桌子上，里边有50镑。

    

‘I found this outside this gentleman's room, ’ she said. ‘Well, ’ I said to the manager, ‘there is still some honesty in this world!’

‘我在这位先生房间外捡到这个’，她说。‘好吧’，我跟经理说，‘还是有诚信在人间的！’
