Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it came into use.

飞机慢慢地把我逼疯了。我住在机场附近，昼夜抖能听到路过飞机的轰隆声。这机场是很多年前修的，但是不知为啥它不再继续使用了。去年，它又开始用了。

    

    



Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise. I am one of the few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane.

因为噪声而搬走的人肯定走了一百来人了。我是少数没走的之一。有时，我觉得房子都要被来往的飞机震塌了。

    

    



I have been offered a large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody says I must be mad **and they are probably right.**

我得到了一笔搬家补偿款，但是我决定待在这里。每个人都说我肯定疯了，他们可能是对的吧。
