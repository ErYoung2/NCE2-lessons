I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank.

当托尼·斯特尔进来餐厅的时候我正在吃晚餐。托尼多年前在律所工作，但现在他在银行工作。

    



He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table. He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds.

他收入很好，但是他总是从朋友那边借钱还不还。托尼看到我然后走过来，坐在了我这张桌。他从来没跟我借过钱。当他吃饭时，我要他借我20镑。

    



To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately. ‘I have never borrowed any money from you, ’ Tony said, ‘so now you can pay for my dinner!’

大出所望，他马上给了我钱。‘我从来没借过你的钱，’托尼说，‘所以你替我买单吧’。

    



Note:

One good turn deserves another means that **when someone does a favor for you, you should do a favor for them in repayment**; kindness should be rewarded with kindness.
