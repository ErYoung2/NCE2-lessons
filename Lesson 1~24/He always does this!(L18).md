After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there! As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.

在一个乡村小酒店吃过饭后，我就找我的包。我把它落在了门旁边的椅子上然后现在它不在那里了。正当我在寻找的时候，店老板走了过来。

    

    

‘Did you have a good meal?’he asked.  
‘Yes, thank you, ’I answered, ‘but I can't pay the bill . I haven't got my bag. ’  
‘吃得好吗？’他问道。

‘是的，谢谢，’我回答道。‘但是我结不了帐了，我的包没了。’

    

    

The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.  
‘I'm very sorry, ’he said. ‘My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!’

老板边笑边马上走出去了。几分钟后就把包带回来还给我了。

‘我很抱歉，’他说。‘我的狗把包叼到花园了，他经常这么干！’
